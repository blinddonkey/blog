The first
*********
post in the new old blog, which may gradually come to contain versions of previously written bits that I feel an emotional attachment for, as well as any other topics toward which I have become vibrantly aware and opinionated.

This may include
****************
any number of things, including poetry, comments on news and various links, insects (and other topics in the natural world), math, family, farming, music, writing;  too many things, really.


Apropos of this:
****************
In the modern world, we find ourselves served with a banquet of ideas, images, memes, pleasures, titillations beyond the most febrile imagination. I get a handful of different emails purporting to give me the "best of the web" for any given day or week, but the best of these is `Brain Pickings <http://www.brainpickings.org>`_, a different view of what is important, curated and presented by Maria Popova.

I was reminded
==============
by her, that we are like Templeton, E.B. White's rat in *Charlottes's Web*, at the fair, sniffing out the precious trash whilst the fair goes on up above our view. We complain about how horrid the internet is, the advertising and general trash that we must sift through to find even a small nugget of useful information, while forgetting that, not only is the actual world wide web somewhere else, above and around us though out of view, but that we rats scurrying about the detritus of the world's accumulated knowledge and wisdom are nosing around *in our own trash*, as we are the ones who built the structure in the first place. How proud we are when we find a word or image that we identify with. "Some Pig!", we shout, with Templeton and Charlotte, showing the value of our selves, here amongst the broken crockery and gum wrappers, having forgotten our home, the city above, lost like a dream from our childhood.

A few final words
*****************
about symbols, and the way meaning is stripped from ideas.

Some years ago
==============
I taught school; grades four through eight, science. I also had some responsibility in "character education". It was a charter school.

Because I value object lessons,
-------------------------------
I put the following symbols up on the overhead screen:

        I <3 U

and asked the class to describe and interpret them. They said, of course, "I love you". I thanked them, then put these symbols up:

        I <3 U 2


Then, we had some discussion.
-----------------------------
I asked the class if any of them felt they could come up in front of the class and say those words to a classmate, looking in their eyes in all seriousness. They were horrified. No. *That's only for people who you really, really like. Special people.* They could not even say it when *describing* saying it.

Then I asked them if they had ever used those symbols, say, in a text. They all said yes.

It seems obvious to me
======================
that the use of typographical symbols, in this context, allows us to ignore the meaning of the ideas that have been symbolized. It's as if, rather than lying back in a grassy meadow sucking on a mint stem, we choose to sit at a desk and suck on a Tic-Tac.

And it's true. That is exactly what we do.

Welcome
